# About


We, **[M$ Club](https://github.com/make-money-sysu)**, are aiming to construct a cloud platform for college students to earn pocket money by doing simple tasks. 

**Make-Money project** is an operation-oriented service software and it's also a professional "crowdsourcing" system for college students. In our system, `Cloud Service Center` provides constantly improving business. Each student has the privilege to own a `M$ Client`. Some `Agencies`, called cows, arrange platforms for their tasks. Basic business includes assigning requirements and offering salaries by system, obtaining the extra money and using money to release the task or withdraw cash by clients. Our system does not support free transactions for the moment.

**Make-Money System** is the integration of many complex systems, including student management system, task management system, transaction management system, account management system, etc. The difficulty of our system lies in operation, that is, the discovery and delivery of tasks (business).
